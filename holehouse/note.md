## regression or classification algorithms
1. gradient decent (easy and good)
2. least square method (easy and good)
3. logistic regression (easy and good)
4. backward propagation neural network (complicated and the parameters are not easy to choose)
5. support vector machine (code is easy, but algorithm itself is difficult, and i don't know why the output is so bad)

## cluster algorithms
1. k-means (sometimes will never converge, but it is good when the dataset can really be classified)

## fixme 
1. network_works.py works well, but the boundary is a straight line.it is wrong, figure it out next time.
